My wife was in Stockholm on vacation of a few years back and--craving a coffee--she did a quick Yelp search and ended up at a place that looked like they could make a decent cappuccino, where she immediately bumped into a friend from back home in Los Angeles. When she first told me about it, it wasn't anything more than a funny story, but over time, it has come to be a useful parable to illustrate a growing feeling of sameness present in many of the places we've been in recent years. The two had traveled halfway around the world and ended up in a place that looked and felt no different than somewhere they'd likely have bumped into each other back home.

- Even thinking outside the box happens in a predictable way
